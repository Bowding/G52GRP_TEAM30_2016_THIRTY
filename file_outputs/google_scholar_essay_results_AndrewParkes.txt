Essay Title: Finiteness in rigid supersymmetric theories
Author(s): A Parkes, P West
Publication Date: 1984/4/12
Description: The two-loop  function for an arbitrary rigid supersymmetric theory is given. The necessary and 
sufficient conditions for a rigid supersymmetric theory to be finite at one loop are derived. It is 
shown that these conditions also imply two-loop finiteness.   ... Volume 138B, number 1,2,3 PHYSICS
